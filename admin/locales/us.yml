notification-message: The site infrastructure has been updated. Some users did not suit us and we had to delete their accounts. This was done in order to improve security and improve user synchronization algorithms. You can re-create the user. Data on the plan and how much the user has replenished and withdrawn will be updated for some time. We apologize for the inconvenience caused!
